    -- Brief Aside: **What is LSP?**
    --
    -- LSP stands for Language Server Protocol. It's a protocol that helps editors
    -- and language tooling communicate in a standardized fashion.
    --
    -- In general, you have a "server" which is some tool built to understand a particular
    -- language (such as `gopls`, `lua_ls`, `rust_analyzer`, etc). These Language Servers
    -- (sometimes called LSP servers, but that's kind of like ATM Machine) are standalone
    -- processes that communicate with some "client" - in this case, Neovim!
    --
    -- LSP provides Neovim with features like:
    --  - Go to definition
    --  - Find references
    --  - Autocompletion
    --  - Symbol Search
    --  - and more!
    --
    -- Thus, Language Servers are external tools that must be installed separately from
    -- Neovim. This is where `mason` and related plugins come into play.

    --  Add any additional override configuration in the following tables. Available keys are:
    --  - cmd (table): Override the default command used to start the server
    --  - filetypes (table): Override the default list of associated filetypes for the server
    --  - capabilities (table): Override fields in capabilities. Can be used to disable certain LSP features.
    --  - settings (table): Override the default settings passed when initializing the server.
    --        For example, to see the options for `lua_ls`, you could go to: https://luals.github.io/wiki/settings/

    -- NOTE: nvim-lspconfig already init with LazyVim by default, so this is the extra configs
