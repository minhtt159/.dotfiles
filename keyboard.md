# RULE !!!

This layout was built specifically for Kinesis Advantage 360.

This layout is intended for 3x6 layer,
but also can reduce to 3x5 or extend to 4x6 if needed. (e.g. Charybdis)

Most of the symbol keys are in homerow and 2 adjacent rows.

These keys are positioned to support in VIM action, also language like Go/Python/Yaml/Bash.
